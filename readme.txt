#A Simple Java ME Game

This game was created as per an assignment requirement in my studies.

I initially wanted to create something more like Flappy Bird in Java ME, but I could not get it right, and changed it to simple time-racing game xD

Two audio files 'gamewin.mp3' and 'gameover.mp3' where excluded from the Resources folder because I forgot the real owners (they both were CC-licensed.)

I hope this will help someone in their beginnings of game development.
